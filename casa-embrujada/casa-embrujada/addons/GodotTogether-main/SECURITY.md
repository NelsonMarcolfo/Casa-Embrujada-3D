# Reporting vulnerabilities

Do not use issues on GitHub for reporting security vulnerabilities as they will be publicly visible.

Please use the [GitHub's security advisories](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/GodotTogether/security/advisories/new) or contact me at wolfyxon@gmail.com instead.

## Supported versions
- ✅ Current source code
- ✅ Latest pre-release (if newer than the latest stable release)
- ✅ Latest release

If you're looking for safety tips, see [the wiki](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/GodotTogether/wiki/Safety-tips).
