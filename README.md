👻 Virtual Tour of the Haunted House 👻
Overview
This project is an interactive 3D simulation that immerses the user in a virtual journey full of suspense 😱,
visual effects and surround sounds. The main goal is to provide an immersive scary experience from home 🏡
demonstrating the potential of technology for entertainment, creative expression and technical skill development.

Goals
• Visualize an interactive horror experience in a 3D environment. 👁️‍🗨️
• Allow users to explore details of a virtual haunted house. 🗺️
• To provide a basis for possible further expansions or experiences. ✨

Features
• Realistic 3D models of a haunted house and its elements. 🏚️
• Interactive camera controls (movement, interaction with objects). 🎮
• Basic lighting and shading for depth and realism. 💡
• Precise spatial arrangements based on a house architecture. 📏
• Surround sound effects and activated horror elements. 🔊

Technologies used
• Godot Engine - Main game engine for simulation development. ⚙️
• OpenGL - For GPU-accelerated 3D rendering within Godot. 🖥️
• Sketchfab - Platform used for obtaining 3D models. 🖼️
• Tripo Studio - Tool for the improvement and creation of 3D models. 🛠️

Installation
1.  Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/NelsonMarcolfo/Casa-Embrujada-3D 
2.  Open the project in Godot Engine. 🚀
3.  Executes the main scene. ▶️
No additional configuration is required if Godot is properly installed and configured for OpenGL.
